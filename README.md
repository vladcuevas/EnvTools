# EnvTools

## Description

This repository is a footprint of the common environment configurations required to code. The idea is to avoid long déjà vu configuration and save time when a new system require the same configuration.

### Current Envs

As of now there is information for two configurations in this repository:

1. [ESLint](https://github.com/vladcuevas/EnvTools/tree/master/ESLint) - Baseline configuration for Linux Mint 19.
2. [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/vladcuevas/EnvTools/tree/master/Sublime%20Text) - Sometimes on windows, the context menu is not added.
